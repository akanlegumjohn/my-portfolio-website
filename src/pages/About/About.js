        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I love analytical thinking when it comes to programming and problem
          solving because that makes you outstanding. <br />I studied and
          obtained my first degree in computer engineering between the year 2019
          and 2023 in the Kwame Nkrumah University of science and Technology
